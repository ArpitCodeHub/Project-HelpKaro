        <!-- About Content -->
        <p class="intro-text">
          In today's world, countless resources such as
          <strong>books, clothes, stationery</strong>, and other essentials
          often go unused or discarded, while many individuals struggle to
          access these basic necessities. At
          <span class="highlight">HelpKaro</span>, we are committed to
          <span class="highlight">reducing resource wastage</span> and ensuring
          these valuable items reach those who need them the most.

            >. Through collective efforts, generosity, and compassion, we strive
            to bridge the gap between privilege and need, ensuring that no one
            is left behind. By fostering a culture of giving, we aim to empower

        <!-- What We Do -->
        <div class="content-box what-we-do">
          <h2>🌱 What We Do</h2>
          <ul>
            ✅ Allow users to
            <strong>list books, clothes, and stationery</strong>
            for donation.
            <br />

            ✅ Provide
            <span class="highlight">pickup preferences</span>
            for easy donation.
            <br />

            ✅ Let recipients
            <strong>request items</strong>
            that match their needs.
          </ul>
          <br />
          We believe that every small contribution holds the power to create
          meaningful change. A donated book can educate a child, a set of
          clothes can bring comfort to the underprivileged, and essential
          stationery can empower students to pursue their dreams.
